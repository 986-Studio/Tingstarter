# Tingstarter



### Library used
 Tingstarter use two main libraries as it's core to scrape information from Kickstarter:
 - a slightly modified version of [argaen/kickscraper](https://github.com/argaen/kickscraper)
 - a heavily modified KS comments scrapper from [sheriferson/KSComCheck](https://github.com/sheriferson/KSComCheck)

Both lib are directly embedded into the app to prevent potential dependencies issues, and because of the modifications.
